Exercise
=========

.. note::
   Before starting the exercise, install the following packages
   

::

    yum install -y words # Installs a file that contains a long list of words
    yum install -y ntp  
    yum install -y tree

Finding files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Which binary file executes when running the lsb_release command?  
#. Find the words file
#. Find the ntp.conf file
#. Copy all the pdf files located in /usr/share/doc/ to your home directory 
#. Delete all the pdf files located in your home directory 
#. List all the files that are bigger than 10MB inside the /boot directory
#. List all the files that are bigger than 10MB inside the /boot directory and their sizes


Reading from files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Scenario:
    * Display the top 27 lines of the words file.
    * Display the bottom 30 lines of the words file.
#. Which flag is needed in order to open a file using `tail` in a continus mode?
#. List the number of lines of the words file.


Working with files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Scenario:
    * Copy the /etc/hosts file to your home directory.
    * Copy it again in an interactive mode.
    * Move the file to the /tmp directory.
    * Remove the /tmp/hosts file.

#. Create the following structure inside your home directory (use wilde cards) and then delete it recursively:

.. image:: /images/files/dir_tree.jpg
   :height: 100px
   :width: 200 px
   :align: center

Working with links
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Explain what is an inode.
#. Explain the difference between hard link and soft link
#. How can we find the inode of a specific file?
#. Scenario:
   * Create tempdir directory inside your home directory.
   * How many hard links ~/tempdir has? 
   * Explain why in your opinion it has that amount of hard links.
#. Scenario:
   * How many hard links the /etc directory has? 
   * Explain why in your opinion it has that amount of hard links.
#. Scenario:
   * Create tempfile1 file inside your home directory that contains the 'Hello World' sentance (use one command).
   * Create a symlink(soft link) tempfile2 file inside your home directory to tempfile1.
#. Try to create a hard link from your home directory to your kernel file that located in the /boot directory? Explain what happend and why.

Searching in files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Scenario: 
    * Run yum list installed (it prints all the installed packages on your system)
    * Run it again but now grep only the installed packages that their name starts with 'kernel'.
    * Run it again but now paste the output to a kernel_pack.txt file.
    * Append to the kernel_pack.txt file the following 3 lines (use: 'echo' and '>>'):
          * newline1
          * newline2
          * newline3
    * Cat the kernel_pack.txt and grep only the newlines.
    * Use only grep (without cat) to select all the lines execpt the 'newline2' of the kernel_pack.txt file.
#. Which alias the grep command is uses by default?
#. Scenario (note: use the words file):
    * List all the words that start with 'io'.
    * List all the words that end with 'ion'.
    * List all the words that start with 'po', end with 'ute' and contain 7 characters.
    * List all the words that contain five vowels in a row (vowels: a,e,i,o,u).

Editing files through the command line
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Scenario:
    * Install the ntp package, run: yum install -y ntp
    * Copy the ntp.conf file to your home directory
    * Delete all blank lines
    * Delete all commented lines

Compering Files
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
#. Scenario:
    * Copy the top 10 words of the words file to a new file inside your home directory (name it file1)
    * Copy the top 9 words of the words file to a new file inside your home directory (name it file2)
    * Use diff to compare the files and examin the difference
    * Change the first 2 lines inside file1 to 'hello' (using vim)
    * Use diff to compare the files and examine the difference
#. Explain what is a hash of a file?
#. In which use cases would you use hash to comapre files instead of the diff command?
#. Use the md5sum command to calculate the hash of the /etc/hosts file.
